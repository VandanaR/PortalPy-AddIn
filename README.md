PortalPy-AddIn
==============

This uses the Portal Py API as an ArcGIS Desktop Add-In.

##Why does this code not work on my computer / look funny?

I am currently developing in a 10.2 environment from home which requires hard coded values for the location of portalpy.  This means that although I would like to have relative paths in use, it just will not work in my current environment.  I am also considering writing a BAT file to install the correct information in the right location.
